## Labs

### Review process

You create a github repo, write the code to solve the problem. At any time **before the deadline**, you can send me the link to the repo.
If you send the link after the deadline, you will be penalized.

The review is a discussion of your work. It can happen any time before the end of the semester and takes usually around 15 minutes.

Note that if you send code not written by you and you fail at the review, you have to redo your work and send it in again. This way, you will be penalized according to the notes below, since the penalty applies on the sending date.

### Delay penalties:

For each of the labs there are delay penalties. For instance, if you send me the lab on the second day after the deadline, you'll have a -1 on your final mark.

- 1 day: -1 point
- 1-7 days: -2 points
- 7-30 days: -3 points
- 30+ days: -4 points
