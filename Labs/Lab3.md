## Lab 3. MVC
You know about the Model View Controller pattern. In this lab, you'll have to build what you think is the simplest version it.

The task is to have three objects that have the responsibilities of the Model, View and Controller.

- Create a Model. Make sure that you can identify whether your model is a **Domain Model** or a **Transaction Script**
- Specify what the responsibilities of your Controller are and whether it is a Page Controller or a Front Controller. Why?
- What are the responsibilities of the view? Is it a Template View or a Transform View? Why?

In this lab you'll have to write much more explanations than code. Please make your code as simple as possible and the explanation as clear as you can.


## Due date
This lab is due the day of the exam. However, if you won't finish the second lab on time, you can submit #3 on Dec 20 and do #2 until the end of the semester.

Good luck!
